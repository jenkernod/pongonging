    <p><h3>Shadow of the Colossus: The Importance of Gaius and Size Perspective</h3></p>

    <p><font color="green">This purpose of this project is to share the first strong, memorable experience I had when playing a video game.
      Shadow of The Colossus, orginally a PS2 game from 2005 that has been remastered for both the PS3 and PS4 due to it's popularity. You 
      start the game as this young man, Wander, thrown into a very open world with the hopes of reviving a girl. In order to revive the girl, he must
      fight and kill 16 colossi across this strange fantasy world.  
      I recommend playing the game as it contains such beautiful imagery and landscaping along with the intense designs of each of the foes which reflects
      Barthes "The Reality Effect" in The Rustle of Language with emerssive details. Thank You!</font></p>  
  
    <p>In Barthes "The Reality Effect", he states that there is an element of reality that comes apparent from the fine details of game that have nothing to 
      do with plot.I would say this is absolutely correct and Shadow of the Colossus is a wonderful example. There are no English words spoken in the game, 
      similar to LIMBO that we have been studying. You are thrown into a plot that is already taking place. Wander is already starting his mission of reviving 
      the girl. You don't know why, but he wants her to wake up. Your objective is to kill the colossi, revive the girl. Anything else in the game is extra.
      Throughout the game, you pass these small shrines that typically have a salamander with a glowing tail on them. If you manage to kill, catch, and eat
      these salamanders, it gives you a minor health/stamina increase. This does not make any difference to the game play or the plot but adds to the 
      enviornment.</p>
      
    <p>Picking up on small things in your enviornment is where you get the feeling of being in an entirely new world. This game is an open world
      game. Potentially, you can traverse the entire map all at once as opposed to throughout the game if you wish, however, your map function provided in the 
      game the areas are blurred out, blocking the area out so it is not easy to navigate. As you defeat more and more Colossi, more of these clouded map areas 
      unlock and each one has a different landscape. There are some battles that take place underwater, some in the sky, some in grassy plains, etc. There 
      really is not a reason for such variancies other than for the appreciation of the player.</p> 

    <p>The most memorable of the all of the colossi is the third one you fight, The Knight, AKA Gaius. You must swim onto a bridge ascending to a 
      hovering platform over a lake under dark clouds. When you reach the top of the platform, the large pile of rocks in the center start 
      standing up and form Gaius. This is the first part of the game where you feel particularly small and vulnerable as you can see from 
      Example 1, you see how tall Gaius is compared to boy Wander:</p>

  <p>Example 1: <IMG SRC="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/7YHHYthPIc4/maxresdefault.jpg"></p>

    <p>This is the visual you have first of the third colossus. As he rises, you see how much smaller you are than him, and you have to kill him.
      You suddenly feel so small and you are fully emersed into the world and you are the boy trying to kill each of these giants.
