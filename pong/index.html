    <p><h3>Shadow of the Colossus: The Importance of Gaius and Size Perspective</h3></p>

    <p><font color="green">This purpose of this project is to share the first strong, memorable experience I had when playing a video game.
      Shadow of The Colossus, orginally a PS2 game from 2005 that has been remastered for both the PS3 and PS4 due to it's popularity. You 
      start the game as this young man thrown into a very open world with the hopes of reviving a girl. In order to revive the girl, he must
      fight and kill 16 colossi across this strange fantasy world. The most memorable of the colossi is the third one you fight, 
      The Knight, AKA Gaius. You must swim onto a bridge ascending to this hovering platform over a lake under dark clouds. When you reach the 
      top of the platform, the large pile of rocks in the center start standing up and form Gaius. 
      I recommend playing the game as it contains such beautiful imagery and landscaping along with the intense designs of each of the foes. Thank You!</font></p>  

    <p>This is the first part of the game where you feel particularly small 
      and vulnerable as you can see from Example 1, you watch the large enemy get taller and he stands:</p>

  <p>Example 1: <IMG SRC="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/7YHHYthPIc4/maxresdefault.jpg"></p>

    <p>This is the visual you have first of the third colossus. As he rises, you see how much smaller you are than him, and you have to kill him.
      You suddenly feel so small and you are fully emersed into the world and you are the boy trying to kill each of these giants."</p>
