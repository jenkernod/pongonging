  <p><h3>Shadow of the Colossus: The Reality Effect of Landscapes and Gaius</h3></p>
  <p>The purpose of this project is to share the first strong, memorable experience I had when playing a video game while highlighting Barthes “Reality Effect” with the use of a well made environment. Shadow of The Colossus, originally a PS2 game from 2005 that has been remastered for both the PS3 and PS4 due to its popularity. You start the game as this young man, Wander, thrown into an open fantasy world with the hopes of reviving a girl. In order to revive the girl, he must fight and kill 16 colossi across these strange “Forbidden Lands”. I recommend playing the game as it contains such beautiful imagery and landscaping along with the intense designs of each of the foes which reflects Barthes "The Reality Effect" in The Rustle of Language with immersive details. Thank You!</p>
  <p>In Barthes "The Reality Effect", he states that there is an element of reality that comes apparent from the fine details of the game that have plot value. I would say this is absolutely correct and Shadow of the Colossus is a wonderful example. There are no English words spoken in the game, similar to LIMBO that we have been studying. You are thrown into a plot that is already taking place; Wander is already starting his mission of reviving the girl. You don't know why, but he wants her to wake up. Your objective is established that if he kills the colossi, he will revive the girl. Anything else in the game is extra, not vital to pushing the story forward. Throughout the game, you pass these small shrines that typically have a salamander with a glowing tail on them. If you manage to kill, catch, and eat these salamanders, it gives you a minor health/stamina increase. This does not make any difference to the game play or the plot but adds to the environment. Picking up on small things in your environment is where you get the feeling of being in an entirely new world. This game is an open world, meaning as the player, you can go as far as the world allows at your leisure. Potentially, you can traverse the entire map all at once as opposed to throughout the game if you wish, however, this open world is used differently than other games. Typically if there is an open world, there are “side missions” that do not change the main storyline, but give more content and gameplay to the player. There are no side missions, there is no motivation for someone to run around the map freely because there is nothing else to gain other than the vast sights to see. The landscapes across these lands vary wildly. There are some battles with your foes that take place underwater, in the sky, in grassy plains, in a dried lakebed, in a sandpit, etc. Each individual colossus is different in appearance, size, stature, etc., with incredible detailing on every inch of each enemy. There is not a reason for such variances other than for the appreciation and immersion of the player.</p>
  <p>The most memorable of all of the colossi is the third one you fight, The Knight, AKA Gaius. You must swim onto a bridge ascending to a hovering platform over a lake under dark clouds. Approaching this area from between a valley crevice seems so daunting due to the weather and the fact you cannot see what is at the top. When you reach the top of the platform, the large pile of rocks that you see in the center starts standing up and forms Gaius. The third colossus is the first one that makes you feel incredibly small, with no obvious way of climbing him until he attacks you. He is also the first colossus to have three spots of vulnerability that you have to climb and destroy in order to defeat the enemy. He is the first one to me that really felt like a challenge the first time playing when I was young on my Playstation2. This is the visual you have of the third colossus (see below). As he rises, you see how much smaller you are than him, and you have to kill him in order to complete your mission.</p> 
  <p>This game truly is beautiful and typically gameplay only falls to roughly 3-4 hours when you know what you are doing; solving the puzzles of how to kill each one could jack the time up quite a bit. I highly recommend this game not only because the story is intriguing but the sights around are so hard to look away from and it's quite frankly peaceful escapism into a new world. If you need a moment away to relax, this game is perfect for beautiful sights, light problem solving skills, and intrigue into a new world. Thank you!</p>
